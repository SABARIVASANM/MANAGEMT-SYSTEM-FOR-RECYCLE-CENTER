# MANAGEMT-SYSTEM-FOR-RECYCLE-CENTER
The Recycling Center System is a Java-based application designed to manage and optimize municipal/commercial recycling operations. It features role-based user authentication, pickup scheduling, waste sorting, inventory tracking, and automated sales reporting with JFreeChart visuals. The system uses MySQL for robust backend storage, with auto-initialized schemas and seed data. A Swing-based UI with input validation ensures a smooth and error-free user experience.
This project was developed with the support of online resources, documentation, and guidance from ChatGPT and developer forums.
